\section{Notes}
Laboratory exercise and data analysis : Programming and statistics

Should introduce the course, perhaps base it more on course plan.
Course: Nuclear Physics and Reactors?
The course covers theoretical models that describe atomic nuclei.
The student is also introduced to the detection of nuclear radiation and the experimental part of the field \ref{web:course}.

I was supervising a laboratory exercise in the course, called $\gamma$-spectroscopy.
This is a full day lab which can be split up in two parts, before lunch walking through theory of $\gamma$ rays and radiation detectors and after lunch performing measurements and


Students unclear of what/how to do it? Student wants to be given the code directly\dots

Course home page: \url{http://www.fysik.lu.se/english/education/courses/basic-level/fysc01-course-package/nuclear-physics/}

Is the course plan walked through?

Need to expand this part \dots


\subsection{Possible solutions}
Define the aims/objectives of the lab more clearly. Clarify formulas even more.

There is a swift change in the method of learning.
Studying theory (students do this in a certain way) and then they need to acquire the craft/skill of performing data analysis, i.e. daq and statistical analysis.
There is a resistance from the students here.
Rephrase this as a challenge.

Solutions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Need better motivation to facilitate change
  \item Clarify early on: $\gamma$-spectroscopy and data analysis
  \item Provide some background theory to the data analysis as well (on intro-meeting?)
  \item Strive to center the data analysis in general for the complete course.
\end{itemize}
